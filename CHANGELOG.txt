v15.0 (2025-11-29)
- The minimum required PHP version has been raised to 7.4.
- All PHP dependencies have been updated to the max possible version which still support PHP 7.4.
- The update of league/commonmark solved some security vulnerabilities: CVE-2025-46734, GHSA-c2pc-g5qf-rfrf

v14.5 (2025-11-29)
- The whole commit history has been forged onto Laravel v8.x.
  The project was originally created with some early Laravel v5.5 dev stage commit, and files have been updated to v8.x with the Allo GUI v14.1.
  Such manual updates of Laravel backbone is time-consuming and difficult to review. With a shared commit history,
  our commits and custom files can instead be rebased, which is after all a lot easier.
  Future updates to newer Laravel major versions will be made via rebase as well,
  with new Allo GUI major versions since they require higher PHP versions and hence won't be supported on older Debian versions anymore.
- While understanding Laravel better, a major cleanup has been applied, removing unused .env variables, views/blades, routes, controllers,
  PHP dependencies, and code sections.
- All other dependencies have been updated to the latest possible version while keeping PHP 7.3 support.

v14.4 (2023-05-25)
- The overview page will now show correctly the GMediaRender service status

v14.3 (2023-05-24)
- Services are now regularly "enabled"/"disabled" when toggling the state, possible with the service handling rework in DietPi v8.16.
- Toggling GMediaRender will now correctly toggle the "gmediarender.service", used since DietPi v8.10.
